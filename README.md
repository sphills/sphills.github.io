Take a look at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sagephillips/" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>!

I'm available for freelance work, and have some examples of some simple frontend-focused projects with a little bit of using the `fetch` API in JavaScript.

<a href="https://sphills.github.io/helldivers_2/" target="_blank">A desktop-focused mockup for a web app integration with Arrowhead games smash-hit Helldivers 2 where a player can keep track of their ship upgrade status can be found here</a>, featuring a fun little Easter egg where the name of the ship is the name I gave my ship in-game.

And finally, a picture of me on my first motorcycle, whom I love very much and enjoy riding through the countryside on:
