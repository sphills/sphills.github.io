I'm available for freelance work, and have some examples of some simple frontend-focused projects with a little bit of using the `fetch` API in JavaScript.

[A responsive mockup for a web app integration with Activision's Modern Warfare II side mode *DMZ* where a player can keep track of their mission completion status can be found here](https://sphills.github.io/dmz_missions/).

[A desktop-focused mockup for a web app integration with Arrowhead games smash-hit Helldivers 2 where a player can keep track of their ship upgrade status can be found here](https://sphills.github.io/helldivers_2/), featuring a fun little Easter egg where the name of the ship is the name I gave my ship in-game.

And finally, a picture of me on my first motorcycle, whom I love very much and enjoy riding through the countryside on:
